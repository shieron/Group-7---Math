##### SAUL & UDIT's Part ----- Technology and Relationship

# 1 Ex. Do people that met online [rel1, 1] perceive their quality of life higher [q1] or lower?

onlineRel <- mean((df[df[,"rel1"] == 1, "q1"]), na.rm = TRUE)
offlineRel<- mean((df[df[,"rel1"] == 2, "q1"]), na.rm = TRUE)

hist((df[df[,"rel1"] == 1, "q1"]), na.rm = TRUE)

hist((df[df[,"rel1"] == 2, "q1"]), na.rm = TRUE)



# 2 Does technology assist in meeting a partner? 




# 3 Is there a difference between people’s happiness with their partner for those who met their person online vs offline?



# 4 For people who say that they are looking for a partner, look at the proportion of who are using online dating


sum(((df[,"mar4"] == 1) *1), na.rm = TRUE) # total number of people looking for a relationship 



sum((df[df[,"mar4"] == 1, "date6"] == 1)*1, na.rm = TRUE) #number of people that are looking for a relationship & using online dating 
sum((df[df[,"mar4"] == 1, "date6"] == 2)*1, na.rm = TRUE) #number of people that are looking for a relationship &  are NOT using online dating 



# 5 For people that say it’s difficult / easy to meet people in their city/state, see how many people using online dating?

sum((df$meet == 1), na.rm = TRUE) #easy to meet 
sum((df$meet == 2), na.rm = TRUE) # difficult 



sum((df[df[,"date6"] == 1 , "meet"] == 1) , na.rm =  TRUE) # number of people with an online dating page, that find it easy to meet people 

sum((df[df[,"date6"] == 1 , "meet"] == 2) , na.rm =  TRUE) # number of people with an online dating page, that find it difficult  to meet people 


sum((df[df[,"date6"] == 1 , "meet"]) , na.rm =  TRUE) # 59 people with dating pages answered the question about th edifficulty to meet people. 

summary(df[,"date6"] == 1) 

summary(df[,"meet"] == 1 )


# 6 Does meeting a partner online fostering a bonding relationship with partner? For example, from the question about someone believes that internet / cellphone have a NEGATIVE / ZERO impact with relationship [REL6/ REL7] → see % of them that use cellphone to send / receive nude pictures [Q13] and not having any fight within 30 days [REL8] ☺ ☺



# 7 Ex. How is the use of Social Media Networks and Twitter affect relationships?
#Can we see the relationship between marital status [MAR] / gender [SEX] / confident [DATE7] / social activity [LOC3] with using online dating  [DATE1A / DATE2A]? For example to see married men / women use online dating as well ☺ ? The initial hypothesis is that: only single / divorced men / women that use online dating



# 8 Relationship between privacy [REL4 and REL5] and having a fight in a relationship [REL8]? Does person who shares password/account together tend to have more fights than those who are not?




# 8 Would you say that technolgy is having a major impact on your relationship

sum(((df[,"rel6"] == 1)* 1), na.rm = TRUE) #major
sum(((df[,"rel6"] == 2)* 1), na.rm = TRUE) #minor
sum(((df[,"rel6"] == 3)* 1), na.rm = TRUE) #no effect
